# Concept: A New Better Version of Craigslist made Grounds up 

# (WeShare?) PaaS (Craigslist but better)

Node Front End Delivery and Backend Workings

# RETHINKDB

THIS PROJECT Utilizies Open Sourced Technologies RETHINKDB 
as a NoSQL Method of Storing User Data inside of the RETHINKDB
Database hosted on either the local machine or closed lan configured server
UNABLE TO RUN ON PI's
The program is relatively too intensive by nature because its so simplified the
stacks cause it to use too much ram and processing power and will not Run on
Any IoT scaled Devices with much fidelity as required for an Even semi large ammount
of connected clients


# Working ENVIRONMENT

Windows10 Test ENV
Capable of Linux Deploy with relative Ease

# Design Idea : 

Node v10.16.0 : 
- WebApp
- using modules HTTPS, squirelly.js Express.JS BcryptJS
- noCAPTCHA reCAPTCHA v2 systems from Google
- Rethink DB

IMPLEMENTATION OF NOSQL!!!
Using Json like RethinkDB


PORT HTTP 80 ENV DEBUG ONLY
!!! 
# SECURITY CONCERNS:
Ensure no SQL Injection (like) Vulns
filter all user  input duh, the json RethinkDB NoSQL really does the rest
Encrypt all Data with Failsafes
--BCRYPT
salts()
HTTP(S) ONLY Using HSTS 
We gots the CloudFlare
443

Failsafe Procedure:
MasterKey - Runtime Execution Protection Protection using Masterkey Salt in run time to crypt all data for Security and Master Encryption of all Possibly Confidential and HIPAA compliant User Data
I could also definitely figure implementation of FIDO Authentication Modules for Hardware Key based platform authentication




# Functional Future Design Ideas:
---> Maybe Consider eCommerce functions using Paypal API?? ((Scrapped??))
--> Mostly focused on USDC (USD Coin) Crypto Exchange within the base of the site for promotions of material
